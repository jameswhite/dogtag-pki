Description: Dogtag Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Suite
 The Dogtag Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Suite is comprised of the following
 six subsystems and a client (for use by a Token Management System):
 .
   * Certificate Authority (CA)
   * Data Recovery Manager (DRM)
   * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager
   * Registration Authority (RA)
   * Token Key Service (TKS)
   * Token Processing System (TPS)
   * Enterprise Security Client (ESC)
 .
 Additionally, it provides a console GUI application used for server and
 user/group administration of CA, DRM, OCSP, and TKS, javadocs on portions
 of the Dogtag API, as well as various command-line tools used to assist with
 a PKI deployment.

Description: Certificate System - PKI Server Framework
 The PKI Server Framework is required by the following four PKI subsystems:
 .
     the Certificate Authority (CA),
     the Data Recovery Manager (DRM),
     the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager, and
     the Token Key Service (TKS).
 .
 This package is a part of the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.
 The package contains scripts to create and remove PKI subsystems.

Package: pki-ca
Architecture: all
Depends: ${java:Depends}, ${misc:Depends},

Suggests: 389-ds-base
Description: Certificate System - Certificate Authority
 The Certificate Authority (CA) is a required PKI subsystem which issues,
 renews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and
 publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
 .
 The Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing Certificate
 Authority, where it is the root CA, or it can act as a subordinate CA,
 where it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.
 .
 This package is a part of the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.

Description: Certificate System - PKI Console

Description: Certificate System - Data Recovery Manager
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Data Recovery Manager (DRM) is an optional PKI subsystem that can act
 as a Key Recovery Authority (KRA).  When configured in conjunction with the
 Certificate Authority (CA), the DRM stores private encryption keys as part of
 the certificate enrollment process.  The key archival mechanism is triggered
 when a user enrolls in the PKI and creates the certificate request.  Using the
 Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request is
 generated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored in
 the DRM which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
 be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
 protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.
 .
 Note that the DRM archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,
 since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys.

Package: pki-ocsp
Architecture: any
Depends: ${java:Depends}, ${misc:Depends},
 pki-server (= ${binary:Version}),
Suggests: pki-ca
Description: Certificate System - Online Certificate Status Protocol Manager
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager is an optional PKI
 subsystem that can act as a stand-alone OCSP service.  The OCSP Manager
 performs the task of an online certificate validation authority by enabling
 OCSP-compliant clients to do real-time verification of certificates.  Note
 that an online certificate-validation authority is often referred to as an
 OCSP Responder.
 .
 Although the Certificate Authority (CA) is already configured with an
 internal OCSP service.  An external OCSP Responder is offered as a separate
 subsystem in case the user wants the OCSP service provided outside of a
 firewall while the CA resides inside of a firewall, or to take the load of
 requests off of the CA.
 .
 The OCSP Manager can receive Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) from
 multiple CA servers, and clients can query the OCSP Manager for the
 revocation status of certificates issued by all of these CA servers.
 .
 When an instance of OCSP Manager is set up with an instance of CA, and
 publishing is set up to this OCSP Manager, CRLs are published to it
 whenever they are issued or updated.

Description: Certificate System - Registration Authority
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Registration Authority (RA) is an optional PKI subsystem that acts as a
 front-end for authenticating and processing enrollment requests, PIN reset
 requests, and formatting requests.
 .
 An RA communicates over SSL with a Certificate Authority (CA) to fulfill
 the user's requests. An RA may often be located outside an organization's
 firewall to allow external users the ability to communicate with that
 organization's PKI deployment.

Suggests: pki-ca
Description: Certificate System - Token Key Service
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Token Key Service (TKS) is an optional PKI subsystem that manages the
 master key(s) and the transport key(s) required to generate and distribute
 keys for hardware tokens.  TKS provides the security between tokens and an
 instance of Token Processing System (TPS), where the security relies upon the
 relationship between the master key and the token keys.  A TPS communicates
 with a TKS over SSL using client authentication.
 .
 TKS helps establish a secure channel (signed and encrypted) between the token
 and the TPS, provides proof of presence of the security token during
 enrollment, and supports key changeover when the master key changes on the
 TKS.  Tokens with older keys will get new token keys.
 .
 Because of the sensitivity of the data that TKS manages, TKS should be set up
 behind the firewall with restricted access.

Description: Certificate System - Token Processing System
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Token Processing System (TPS) is an optional PKI subsystem that acts
 as a Registration Authority (RA) for authenticating and processing
 enrollment requests, PIN reset requests, and formatting requests from
 the Enterprise Security Client (ESC).
 .
 TPS is designed to communicate with tokens that conform to
 Global Platform's Open Platform Specification.
 .
 TPS communicates over SSL with various PKI backend subsystems (including
 the Certificate Authority (CA), the Data Recovery Manager (DRM), and the
 Token Key Service (TKS)) to fulfill the user's requests.
 .
 TPS also interacts with the token database, an LDAP server that stores
 information about individual tokens.
